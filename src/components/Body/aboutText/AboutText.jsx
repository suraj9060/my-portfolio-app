          My interest in web development started when I was
                trying to edit things on the web - I was Amazed that How things are working On click On scroll How my Photos Are stored file shearing and payment done
                <br /> <br /> <br />I want to create it by my own â€” I taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!.
          Fast Forwarding to today, I built a number of web applications and 4
          major projects. Learned a great deal about teamwork, leadership, and
          communication. After months of rigorous training, here I am looking
          for an opportunity as a full stack web developer.
